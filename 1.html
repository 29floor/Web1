HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <img src="nature.jpg" width="100"> images and other objects,<p> such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    <p>HTML elements are delineated by tags, <p>written using angle brackets.</p>
